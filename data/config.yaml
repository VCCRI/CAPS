# Mutability table. Contains 104 entries: 32 context sequences
# (4^3 divided by 2 because of complementarity), times
# 3 possible mutations of the middle nucleotide at methylation level 0,
# plus for context sequences ACG, CCG, GCG and TCG
# (which all have C adjacent to G) there are 8 additional possible
# CpG transitions at methylation levels 1 and 2.
